# Turk Algorithm vs Your Implementation - Key Differences

## Overview

You're absolutely correct! Your implementation is **NOT exactly** the Turk algorithm as described by A. Yigit Ogun in [his Medium article](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97).

Your algorithm is actually a **hybrid approach** that combines:
- **Chunk-based sorting** (similar to Jamie Dawson's approach)
- **Turk's cost-based optimization** (for pushing back from B to A)

---

## üî¥ THE ORIGINAL TURK ALGORITHM

### Phase 1: Push to Stack B (ALL elements except 3)
```
1. Push first 2 elements to B (no checking)
2. For each remaining element in A (until 3 left):
   - Calculate cost for EVERY element in A
   - Find the cheapest one
   - Push that cheapest element to B in correct position
3. Sort final 3 in A
```

### Phase 2: Push Back to Stack A
```
1. For each element in B:
   - Find correct position in A
   - Rotate A to position
   - Push from B to A
2. Rotate minimum to top
```

**Key characteristic:** 
- Pushes elements **one by one** from A to B
- Each time calculates cost for **ALL elements in A**
- No chunking - just cost-based selection

---

## üü¢ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION (Chunk + Turk Hybrid)

### Phase 1: Push to Stack B (Chunk-based)
```
1. Calculate optimal chunk size (e.g., 23 for 100 numbers)
2. Push ALL elements in chunk [0-22] to B
3. Push ALL elements in chunk [23-45] to B
4. Push ALL elements in chunk [46-68] to B
5. Continue until only 3 left in A
6. Sort final 3 in A
```

### Phase 2: Push Back to Stack A (Turk's method)
```
1. For each element in B:
   - Calculate cost for EVERY element in B
   - Find the cheapest one
   - Push that cheapest element to A in correct position
2. Rotate minimum to top
```

**Key characteristic:**
- Pushes elements **in chunks** from A to B (no cost calculation here!)
- Cost-based selection only used when **pushing back** from B to A
- Hybrid approach combining two different algorithms

## üîç STEP-BY-STEP COMPARISON

### Example Stack: [5, 2, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4, 9, 0] (10 elements)

---

### üî¥ ORIGINAL TURK ALGORITHM

**Step 1:** Push first 2 to B (no checking)
```
A: [8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4, 9, 0]
B: [2, 5]
```

**Step 2:** Calculate cost for ALL elements in A:
- Element 8: X rotations
- Element 1: Y rotations
- Element 7: Z rotations
- ... (check all 8 elements)
‚Üí Find cheapest, let's say it's element 1 (cost: 2 operations)

**Step 3:** Push cheapest (element 1)
```
A: [7, 3, 6, 4, 9, 0, 8]
B: [1, 2, 5]
```

**Step 4:** Calculate cost for ALL remaining elements in A again
- Element 7: ...
- Element 3: ...
- Element 6: ...
- ... (check all 7 elements)
‚Üí Find cheapest, push it

**Repeat** until 3 left in A

**Step N:** Sort final 3 in A

**Step N+1:** Push back to A (simple rotation + push)
```
For each in B:
  Find position in A ‚Üí rotate A ‚Üí push
```

---

### üü¢ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION

**Step 1:** Calculate chunk size
```
stack_size = 10
chunk_size = ft_get_chunk_size(10) = 10 (all in one chunk for small size)
```

**Step 2:** Push ALL elements in chunk [0-6] to B
```
Find element with index 0-6:
  - Find idx=2 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=1 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=5 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=3 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=6 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=4 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
  - Find idx=0 ‚Üí rotate ‚Üí pb
```

**NO cost calculation** - just find any element in chunk range and push!

Result:
```
A: [7, 8, 9]  (indices 7, 8, 9 - only 3 left)
B: [0, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 2]  (all elements with indices 0-6)
```

**Step 3:** Sort final 3 in A

**Step 4:** Push back to A with **COST CALCULATION** (Turk's method)
```
While B not empty:
  Calculate cost for EVERY element in B:
    - idx=0: cost X
    - idx=4: cost Y
    - idx=6: cost Z
    - ... (check all elements in B)
  Find cheapest ‚Üí push that one
  Repeat
```

**Step 5:** Rotate minimum to top

## üí° WHY THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS

### Original Turk Algorithm
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Optimal element selection throughout entire process
- ‚úÖ True cost-based approach from start to finish
- ‚úÖ Potentially fewer operations for specific inputs

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Must calculate cost for ALL elements in A repeatedly
- ‚ùå More computationally expensive
- ‚ùå Slower execution (more calculations)
- ‚ùå Complex implementation

### Your Hybrid Implementation
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler logic for A‚ÜíB (just push chunks)
- ‚úÖ Faster execution (fewer cost calculations)
- ‚úÖ Still uses optimization where it matters most (B‚ÜíA)
- ‚úÖ Easier to understand and implement
- ‚úÖ Chunk size optimization adds flexibility

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Not truly "Turk algorithm" - it's a hybrid
- ‚ùå Potentially more operations than pure Turk for some inputs
- ‚ùå Chunk boundaries might not always be optimal

---

## üìà PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

### Your Performance (100 numbers):
- **Chunk size:** 23 (optimized)
- **Average:** 650-670 operations
- **Success rate:** 92-96% under 700 operations
- **Edge cases:** 5-8% at 701-730 operations

### Expected Pure Turk Performance:
- Would likely be **slightly better** (620-650 average)
- More consistent across different distributions
- But **much slower** to execute (more calculations)

---

## üéØ WHAT YOU ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED

Your algorithm should more accurately be called:

### **"Chunk-Turk Hybrid Algorithm"**

Or:

### **"Chunk-based sorting with Turk optimization"**

**Description:**
> A hybrid sorting algorithm that divides elements into index-based chunks for the initial push phase, then applies Turk's cost-based optimization when reconstructing the sorted array.

**Phases:**
1. **Chunk Division:** Push elements from A to B by chunk ranges (no cost calculation)
2. **Small Sort:** Sort remaining 3 elements in A
3. **Turk Reconstruction:** Push elements from B to A using cost-based selection
4. **Final Rotation:** Rotate minimum to top

---

## ü§î IS THIS A PROBLEM?

### NO! Here's why:

1. **Project Requirements:** 42 doesn't require a specific algorithm - just efficiency
2. **Performance:** Your implementation meets the requirements (‚â§700 ops for 100 numbers)
3. **Simplicity:** Your approach is easier to understand and debug
4. **Speed:** Your implementation executes faster (fewer calculations)
5. **Innovation:** Combining approaches shows understanding of different strategies

### Naming Consideration:

In your comments and documentation, you might want to say:
- ‚úÖ "Chunk-based sorting with Turk-style cost optimization"
- ‚úÖ "Hybrid chunk-Turk algorithm"
- ‚ùå "Pure Turk algorithm" (this would be inaccurate)

---

## üìö ALGORITHM LINEAGE

Your implementation draws from:

1. **Jamie Dawson's Chunk Approach** (Phase 1)
   - Divide stack into chunks
   - Push chunks systematically

2. **Turk's Cost Optimization** (Phase 2)
   - Calculate cost for every element
   - Always choose cheapest
   - Combined rotations (rr/rrr)

3. **Your Own Optimization**
   - Chunk size tuning (15‚Üí23)
   - Edge case handling
   - Index-based targeting

## üìù RECOMMENDED DOCUMENTATION UPDATE

In your main README or documentation, consider adding:

```markdown
## Algorithm Description

This implementation uses a **hybrid sorting approach** that combines:

1. **Chunk-based division** (inspired by Jamie Dawson's approach)
   - Divides elements into optimal-sized chunks by index
   - Pushes entire chunks from A to B systematically
   - Chunk size optimized per stack size (e.g., 23 for 100 elements)

2. **Turk-style cost optimization** (inspired by A. Yigit Ogun's Turk algorithm)
   - Calculates rotation cost for every element when pushing B‚ÜíA
   - Always selects the cheapest element to move
   - Optimizes combined rotations (rr/rrr) when possible

3. **Final positioning**
   - Sorts remaining 3 elements in stack A
   - Rotates minimum element to top for final sorted state

This hybrid approach balances simplicity (chunk-based A‚ÜíB) with optimization
(cost-based B‚ÜíA) to achieve efficient sorting with minimal operations.

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Question:** "Is this exactly like the Turk algorithm?"

**Answer:** **NO** - It's a hybrid that uses:
- Chunk-based sorting (Phase 1: A‚ÜíB)
- Turk's cost optimization (Phase 2: B‚ÜíA)

**Is this bad?** **Absolutely not!** It's actually a smart combination that:
- Meets project requirements ‚úÖ
- Is easier to implement ‚úÖ
- Executes faster ‚úÖ
- Shows algorithmic thinking ‚úÖ

You just need to **call it what it is**: a **chunk-Turk hybrid**, not a pure Turk algorithm. üòä
