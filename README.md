# push_swap üîÑ

A sophisticated sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks and a limited set of operations, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum to explore algorithmic efficiency and data structure manipulation.

## Description üìú

The push_swap project challenges you to sort a stack of integers using the minimum number of operations. You have two stacks (A and B) and a set of specific operations to manipulate them. The goal is to sort all numbers in stack A in ascending order using the fewest possible moves.

**Key Challenge:** Different input sizes have strict operation limits:
‚Ä¢ **3 numbers**: Maximum 3 operations
‚Ä¢ **5 numbers**: Maximum 12 operations  
‚Ä¢ **100 numbers**: Less than 700 operations for full points
‚Ä¢ **500 numbers**: Less than 5500 operations for full points

## Stack Operations Reference üîß

| Operation | Description | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|

| **sb** | swap b | Swap first 2 elements of stack B |  
| **ss** | swap both | Execute sa and sb simultaneously |
| **pa** | push a | Push top element from B to A |
| **pb** | push b | Push top element from A to B |
| **ra** | rotate a | Rotate up (first becomes last) in A |
| **rb** | rotate b | Rotate up (first becomes last) in B |
| **rr** | rotate both | Execute ra and rb simultaneously |
| **rra** | reverse rotate a | Rotate down (last becomes first) in A |
| **rrb** | reverse rotate b | Rotate down (last becomes first) in B |
| **rrr** | reverse rotate both | Execute rra and rrb simultaneously |

## Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

### Building the Project
‚Ä¢ Run `make` to compile the main push_swap executable
```bash
make
```

‚Ä¢ To build the debug version with visual output:
```bash
make debug
```

### Running the Program
‚Ä¢ **Basic usage**: Pass integers as arguments
```bash
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```

‚Ä¢ **Alternative format**: Use quoted string
```bash  
./push_swap "4 67 3 87 23"
```

### Debug & Visualization
‚Ä¢ **Visual debugging**: See step-by-step algorithm execution
```bash
cd debug
./push_swap_debug 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Development Commands
‚Ä¢ **Clean object files**: `make clean`
‚Ä¢ **Remove all generated files**: `make fclean`  
‚Ä¢ **Rebuild from scratch**: `make re`
‚Ä¢ **Check code style**: `make normi`

## Algorithm Strategy üìä

### Small Numbers (2-5 elements)
- **2 elements**: Maximum 1 operation (sa if needed)
- **3 elements**: Maximum 2 operations using conditional logic
- **4-5 elements**: Use of stack B as auxiliary storage

### Large Numbers (100+ elements) - *In Development*
- **Turk Algorithm**: Efficient sorting for larger datasets
- **Chunk-based approach**: Divide and conquer strategy
- **Cost analysis**: Calculate optimal moves for each element
- **Performance targets**: Meet strict operation count requirements

## Used Tests üß™

‚Ä¢ **Custom test suite**: Comprehensive validation with 42+ test cases
‚Ä¢ **Edge case testing**: Empty input, single elements, already sorted arrays
