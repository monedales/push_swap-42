# push_swap üîÑ

A sophisticated sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks and a limited set of operations, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum to explore algorithmic efficiency and data structure manipulation.

## Description üìú

The push_swap project challenges you to sort a stack of integers using the minimum number of operations. You have two stacks (A and B) and a set of specific operations to manipulate them. The goal is to sort all numbers in stack A in ascending order using the fewest possible moves.

**Key Challenge:** Different input sizes have strict operation limits:

- **3 numbers**: Maximum 3 operations

- **5 numbers**: Maximum 12 operations  

- **100 numbers**: Less than 700 operations for full points

- **500 numbers**: Less than 5500 operations for full points

## Stack Operations Reference üîß

| Operation | Description | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **sa** | swap a | Swap first 2 elements of stack A |
| **sb** | swap b | Swap first 2 elements of stack B |  
| **ss** | swap both | Execute sa and sb simultaneously |
| **pa** | push a | Push top element from B to A |
| **pb** | push b | Push top element from A to B |
| **ra** | rotate a | Rotate up (first becomes last) in A |
| **rb** | rotate b | Rotate up (first becomes last) in B |
| **rr** | rotate both | Execute ra and rb simultaneously |
| **rra** | reverse rotate a | Rotate down (last becomes first) in A |
| **rrb** | reverse rotate b | Rotate down (last becomes first) in B |
| **rrr** | reverse rotate both | Execute rra and rrb simultaneously |

## Technologies & Concepts üõ†Ô∏è

‚Ä¢ **Data Structures**: Doubly linked lists for stack implementation

‚Ä¢ **Algorithm Design**: Sorting algorithms optimized for specific constraints

‚Ä¢ **Stack Operations**: Push, pop, swap, rotate operations

‚Ä¢ **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation and proper cleanup

‚Ä¢ **Performance Optimization**: Minimizing operation count for different input sizes

‚Ä¢ **Parsing & Validation**: Robust input handling and error management

‚Ä¢ **Modular Programming**: Clean separation of concerns and reusable functions

## Algorithm Strategy üìä

### Small Numbers (2-5 elements)
- **2 elements**: Maximum 1 operation (sa if needed)
- **3 elements**: Maximum 2 operations using optimized decision tree
- **4-5 elements**: Reduction strategy using stack B as auxiliary storage

### Large Numbers (100-500 elements) - **Turk Algorithm**
- **Chunk-based approach**: Optimized chunk sizes for different dataset sizes
  - 50 elements: chunks of 10
  - 100 elements: chunks of 25
  - 500 elements: chunks of 70
- **Two-phase sorting**:
  - Phase 1 (A‚ÜíB): Push elements to stack B in chunks using cost analysis
  - Phase 2 (B‚ÜíA): Push back to A in optimal order with combined rotations
- **Cost optimization**: Calculate cheapest moves considering both rotation directions
- **Combined operations**: Use rr/rrr when both stacks rotate in same direction
